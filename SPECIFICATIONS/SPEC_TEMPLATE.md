# <Feature name>

## ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA

- [ ] [BLOCKING] <verifiable assertion>
- [ ] [NICE_TO_HAVE] <verifiable assertion>

Each criterion must reduce to one of:
- A command that exits 0 (e.g. `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test`).
- An HTTP request whose response matches a documented Zod schema.

Untagged criteria default to [BLOCKING]. Build and extend agents loop up to 3 attempts per criterion before escalating to the user.
